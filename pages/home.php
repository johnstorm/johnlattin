			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>
				Hi and welcome to my site. I, as you may know, am John Lattin.<br\>
				I started programming at the age of 16 and it has grown to be my favorite hobby.
			</p>

			<h3>What do I program?</h3>
			<p>
				I vigorously trained myself in the art of programming games. What does this mean? I focused my college
				education, and a lot of my free time, on graphics frameworks such as
				<a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> and our mobile friend
				<a href="http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/1.1/docs/man/">OpenGL ES</a>.
				<br> <br>
				I became very active in groups like <a herf="http://huskygames.com/">Husky Game Development </a> and
				organized several events and competitions; including Game Jams and BonzAI Brawl.
			</p>

			<h3>Can I do web development?</h3>
			<p>
				Yes, I know javascript, css and html and am open to do freelance work! Check the <a href="pages/contact.php"> Contact Me </a> page.

				I have fun playing board games with my friends.
